        <h2>Slow Cooker Chicken Broth - Great for Gut health</h2>
        <p>This slow-cooked bone broth uses roasted bones and unpeeled veggies, which produces a much deeper flavor and darker color. 
            For a lighter-colored broth, omit the roasting step and use peeled veggies. The longer this simmers, the richer it gets, 
            however don't go longer than 48 hours as the flavor can turn bitter. Make sure about half your bones are collagen-rich, 
            such as chicken backs, feet, or wings. Season with additional salt, if desired, upon serving.
